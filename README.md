# ARTIFICIAL-NEURAL-NETWORK-MODEL-MARKETING-CAMPAIGN-PROJECT
This project presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)–based customer churn prediction system using the Tele-connect dataset.The primary objective is to identify customers at risk of churning by learning patterns from demographic, service usage, and billing-related attributes, thereby enabling proactive customer retention strategies.

The dataset was preprocessed to ensure data quality and model reliability. Missing values in the TotalCharges variable were handled through coercion and removal of invalid records. Categorical features such as contract type, internet services, payment method, and customer demographics were transformed using one-hot encoding, while numerical features were standardized using feature scaling. The target variable, Churn, was label-encoded into binary classes. A stratified train–test split was applied to preserve class distribution and reduce sampling bias.

A baseline neural network model was initially developed using a simple architecture with two hidden layers and the Adam optimizer. This served as a performance benchmark. Subsequently, an optimized deep neural network architecture was implemented, incorporating multiple hidden layers, ReLU activation functions, dropout regularization to mitigate overfitting, and early stopping to enhance generalization.

To assess the impact of optimization techniques, the optimized ANN was trained using three different optimizers: Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad. Model performance was evaluated using key classification metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and validation loss. These metrics provided a comprehensive assessment of predictive performance, particularly in identifying churned customers where recall and F1-score are critical.

The optimized models demonstrated improved and more stable performance compared to the original baseline model, with RMSprop emerging as the best-performing optimizer based on validation loss and balanced classification metrics. Visual evaluations, including a confusion matrix and validation loss curves, further confirmed improved learning stability and reduced overfitting after optimization.

In conclusion, the results indicate that a well-optimized ANN model can effectively predict customer churn with high reliability. The study highlights the importance of proper data preprocessing, model architecture design, optimizer selection, and regularization techniques in improving classification performance. This approach provides a scalable and data-driven solution that can support decision-makers in developing targeted retention strategies and reducing customer attrition.
